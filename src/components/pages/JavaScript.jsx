          JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that
          allows developers to create interactive and dynamic content within web
          browsers. Unlike HTML and CSS, which primarily deal with structure and
          style, JavaScript provides the ability to add functionality, handle
          events, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), and communicate
          with servers, making web pages more dynamic and user-friendly. fun
